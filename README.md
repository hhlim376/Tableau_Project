# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To turn complex data into easily consumable visualizations using Tableau and to use those visualizations for communicating insights into the data.

&nbsp;

## Process
&nbsp;
### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Explore dataset, identify datatypes
* Get an understanding of what each column represents
* Create Hierarchies in Tableau
* Start creating basic visualizations and explore what the data can tell us
&nbsp;
### Step 2: Come up with Questions
* Identify aspects of data you want to work with
* Come up with questions to answer for this data
&nbsp;
### Step 3: Plan out Dashboard
* Identify what kind of visualizations are needed to answer your questions
* Plan out how you want to organise your dahsboard
### Step 4: Create Dashboard
* Create Visualizations required for Dahsboard
* Arrange and organise visualizations into Dashboards
### Step 5: Prepare for presentation

## Results

&nbsp;
### Option --> For this project I chose to go with option 2 using the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset
&nbsp;

### There were 3 main areas I wanted to explore with this dataset:  
General Information
* What was the distribution of the number of strikes throughout the US?
* What was the breakdown of types of animals struck?
* Of the total number of strikes, what percentage actually caused damage?  

Strike and Date/Time Information
* What is the trend for strikes over time? 
* Which Month had the most amount of strikes?  

Damage causing strike information
* Which phase of flight had the most damage causing strikes?
* What time of day had the most damage causing strikes?
* Was there a relationship between the amount of damage caused by a strike and the impact to the flight?
&nbsp;  

I created one dashboard for each of these areas with visualisations I felt were appropriate to answer the questions posed. For the results to these questions, please see the dashboards included in the Tableau notebook attached or the presentation pdf file.

&nbsp;

## Challenges 
* The desktop version of Tableau public was laggy for me so I switched to the browser version, however the browser version was missing one or two features, most noticeably the option to do clustering and adding forecast lines.

## Future Goals
* I would like to explore more customisation options for the dashboards, perhaps add backgrounds, make everything look nicer
* As mentioned in the challenges section, the web version of Tableau public did not have the option to add forecast lines. I really would have like to add a forecast for the line chart with number of strikes over years, just to show a prediction for how the number of strikes would increase over the next few years.
